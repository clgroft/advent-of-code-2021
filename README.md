## execution

Make sure you have Python 3.9 and pip installed, as well as all requirements in
`requirements.txt` (I recommend using `virtualenv` for this), then run

``` sh
./aoc.py --day _n_
```
to run on the real data, or

``` sh
./aoc.py --day _n_ --input_type test
```
to run on the given test data.
